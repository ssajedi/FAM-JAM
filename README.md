# UPZONE
**Intelligent Spec Management for Revit**

FAM JAM is a Revit Plugin developed during the 2024 [AECTech Hackathon](https://www.aectech.us/la-event). We created a solution aimed at simplifying specification sheet management for Revit, targeting architectural workflows. Fam Jam allows users to seamlessly integrate Revit families with specification sheets, addressing a common bottleneck by turning families into specs, making the process more intuitive and efficient.
