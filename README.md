# FAM JAM
**Intelligent Spec Management for Revit**

FAM JAM is a Revit Plugin developed during the 2024 [AECTech Hackathon](https://www.aectech.us/la-event). We created a solution aimed at simplifying specification sheet management for Revit, targeting architectural workflows. Fam Jam allows users to seamlessly integrate Revit families with specification sheets, addressing a common bottleneck by turning families into specs, making the process more intuitive and efficient. 

# Prerequisites
In order to use FAM JAM, you will require:
* Revit
* [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/)
  
# Getting Started
To use this repository please follow these steps:
* Clone the repository using <git>
* Create an OpenAI API key
* Create secret.txt and add the API Key.
* Place secret.txt inside the main project directory. 
* [To be added by Frank]

# Demo 
Please refer to the following video for a demonstration of how FAM JAM.

# Future work
For future work, we are focusing on several key areas of development to enhance system performance and usability even further:

* Further expansion of the .rfa family database: We plan to continue growing our .rfa repository, providing even more comprehensive options for users to streamline design processes.
Advanced scalability solutions: We are exploring new ways to ensure the platform can support even larger workloads and more complex projects, improving both speed and reliability as usage scales up.
* Enhanced prompting mechanisms: Future updates will focus on making prompts even more intuitive, with the goal of providing instant access to critical tools with minimal user input.
* AI-driven insights for asset selection: We plan to adopt an AI semantic search feature in the workflow, allowing for even smarter asset selection and flitering.
* Improved credential management: Upcoming improvements will include more sophisticated security protocols and user-friendly interfaces for managing credentials
